# Audio Files Instructions

Please place your MP3 files in this directory (`public/audio`).

The file names **must** match the following to work with the current code:

1. `blinding-lights-cover.mp3` - For "Cover Song: Blinding Lights"
2. `cinematic-journey.mp3` - For "Instrumental: Cinematic Journey"
3. `bohemian-rhapsody-cover.mp3` - For "Keyboard Cover: Bohemian Rhapsody"

Once you paste the files here, refresh the page and the audio players will work!
